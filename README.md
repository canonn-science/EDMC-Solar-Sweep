# Solar-Sweep for EDMC

This plugin helps with the Solar Sweep Survey by downloading a list of completed systems and informing the CMDR if the current system has already been been surveyed.

It also provides a clickable link to the survey form with key data already filled in.

# Solar Sweep

The Aim of the Sol Sweep is to create a detailed survey of every system 200 ly around Sol..
For each system, we are asking that each body is flown within 1000ls of, to ensure that nothing in the system is missed.
The objects that are of interest are Generation Ships, Listening Posts, UCBs, Tourist Beacons, INRA Posts, and other unusual or unique objects
If you are unable to record the information of a system or wish for someone to double check, please ask for further inspection.

Generation Ships sould have audio recordings or transcripts of the ship's logs.
Listening Posts should have a screenshot or transcript of the data
UCB's should have a transcript or recording of the transmission, along with transmission time
Tourist Beacons should have a screenshot of the information
INRA Posts should have coordinates (Optional: Record all the base's logs)

Remember to record even negative results as this will help commanders avoid scanning systems that have already been checked and found empty.
